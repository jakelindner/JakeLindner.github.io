								<h3>Goal of Analysis</h3>
								<ol>
									<li>What is the overall summary of the data professionals and their associated careers?</li>
									<li>What insights can be drawn from this survey in order to break into the data field?</li>
									<li>How did the participants enjoy/rate different parts of their career?</li>
								</ol>

								<h3>Project Details</h3>
								<p>I went into this project excited to put my studying and practice to the test. I wanted to create multiple dashboards that would allow the audience to dive into the data, discover critical takeaways, and answer any questions they had about data professionals. I ended up creating three dashboards. </p>
								<p>The first was an executive summary of the survey participants. My goal was to include the most relevant information to be able to have an understanding of the participants and their careers quickly. The second dashboard's goal was to show the participant's opinions and performance in breaking into the data field. I also included the participant's favorite programming language to guide the audience on what languages are popular and help them choose which would be best for them to learn. The third and final dashboard's goal was to display the participant's ratings on different areas and allow the audience to filter down to what interests them the most.</p>
								<p>I collected some powerful insights from this:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Less then 1% of the data professionals have a PhD.</li>
									<li>Only 33% of the participants said that data careers were difficult/very difficult to get into.</li>
									<li>Python dominated the favorite programming languages among the participants. If you want to learn a new language, python may be the one for you.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>I want to thank you for looking at my project! I have enjoyed applying my studies to a tangible project where I can hopefully inspire others as well. I would also encourage you to download the project and try your analysis to see what insights you can discover (see the button below).</p>
								<p>Thank you, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-freberg/">Alex Freberg</a>, for sharing this data with the public and taking the time to produce such high quality content.</p>
